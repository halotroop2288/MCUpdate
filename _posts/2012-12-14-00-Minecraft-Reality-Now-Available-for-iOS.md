Apple fans! We’ve recently released Minecraft Reality for iOS.
It lets you view your Minecraft creations in the real word thanks to 13th Lab’s spooky augmented reality technology.

For more info, visit [http://minecraftreality.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20121128043237/http://minecraftreality.com/),
or search for Minecraft Reality on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch.

Have fun!

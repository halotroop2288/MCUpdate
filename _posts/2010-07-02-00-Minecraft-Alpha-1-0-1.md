**Seecret Friday 3**

Minecraft Alpha has been updated to version 1.0.1 (I just arbitrarily decided that the previous version was 1.0.0. :D),
with some bug fixes (does the mouse work better in linux now?) and a metric tonne of Seecret features,
including six new crafting recipes.

You need to explore new areas for some of the new stuff, but not for everything. Dig deep.

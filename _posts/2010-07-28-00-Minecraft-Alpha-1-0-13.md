* New look for the Slimes
* Some work on multiplayer

A bit of a short blog update today, but I ran out of work day. ;D

I’ll leave the MP server up for a while to see if a couple of bugs have been fixed.

[edit:]

Oh, and I forgot about the most important update!

* The client now checks if two instances of the game try to save to the same level, and quits if it does.
* Fixed a hang/crash bug related to lighting. It wasn’t an actual hang bug, just an “each frame of the game
takes exponentially longer to render than the last” bug, which is pretty much the same thing.

As for the server, it’s extremely full, and is currently getting eight connection attempts per second..

* You need shovels to get snowballs now, and you can’t stack as many
* Ice freezes again
* Snow blocks on top of top snow no longer looks weird
* Less annoying snowball sound effect

On the Multiplayer front all is well!<br>
I just finished implementing tile mining and movement verification.
It’s now impossible to claim to mine a tile you can’t mine, or to mine a tile too fast,
and it’s also impossible to move through walls.

I can now log in with several clients and see changes other players do to the world,
although I can’t see the other players yet.

I’ve got a really nice and stable base to build on, I think.
Terrain streaming works great, and tile changes get sent out automatically,
and collapsed into a single message there’s multiple updates within a single chunk.
If the number of updates is really huge, it’ll get replaced with a single replaceregion call, which is compressed.

There’s a slight chance I might stay up late tonight, working on this.. I’m starting to have FUN! =D

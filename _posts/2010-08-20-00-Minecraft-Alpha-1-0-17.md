**Seecret Friday 8**

Both the game and the servers have been updated.
Since servers don’t autoupdate yet, you need to download the latest version from the download page.

Unfortunately, the secret is NOT the inventory, but I did include the first version of something pretty big for SMP.
You’ll know it when you see it.

I also fixed a pile of bugs for SMP like doors acting weird and torches attaching to the wrong walls.

You do not need to explore new terrain this time around.

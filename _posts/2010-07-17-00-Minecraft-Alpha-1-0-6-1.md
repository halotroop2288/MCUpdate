* Fixed stuttering after death bug
* Leaves decay again when not connected to either the ground or to a tree trunk
* Tweaked monster and animal spawning a bit. The game probably is quite a bit more difficult now.
* Boats can be placed on land, and won’t break if you hit land unless you’re going above a certain speed
* Boats spawn water splash particles only when going fast enough to break
* Boats turn much nicer

I just did a quick bug fix update for minecraft, fixing a certain item duplication bug,
attempted to fix the player-getting-stuck-bug, and quite possibly improved the framerate under certain conditions.

There is a performance problem in singleplayer currently.
It’s got my attention, and I will spend time working out what’s going on and improving performance again when I get back.
I consider it a major bug.

**The Caves and Cliffs Update: Part 2**

It’s been quite the trek, but we’re here. At the summit.
The Caves & Cliffs Update: Part II is out today, completing the much anticipated cave update.
What better way to celebrate than by climbing to the top of a higher than ever mountain.
Let’s take a moment and just take in that view. Wait. What’s that sound. Don’t tell me that goat is back.

AAAAARGH.

Ouff! Ouch! Ow!

Where am I? It’s dark down here! It’s almost as if I fell a greater distance than I would have before today.
Figures. While I try to get out of this dripstone cave, I hope you enjoy all of the new features that 1.18 brings.
Could you pass me a candle before you leave? It really is dark down here.

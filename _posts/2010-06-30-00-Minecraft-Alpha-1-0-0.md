Bug fixes include signs working the way they used to, players below the map correctly dying,
and a few minor things Iâ€™ve forgotten about.

The big news is that the stand alone client is pretty much finished!

I will spend the rest of the week phasing out indev and infdev in favor of `/game/`
(where all future updates will be) and resting. And a Seecret Friday update.

Next week, I will start working on Multiplayer Survival mode.

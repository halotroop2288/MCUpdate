I just uploaded a fixed server (no client update) that tries to fix the tool use bug.
It seems to work here with my own tests, both for tools in the first slot and other slots.

You’ll need to re-download the server software from
[http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp](https://web.archive.org/web/20100912104652/http://www.minecraft.net:80/download.jsp)
to apply this update.
And I need to make the server auto-update if it’s running in online mode.

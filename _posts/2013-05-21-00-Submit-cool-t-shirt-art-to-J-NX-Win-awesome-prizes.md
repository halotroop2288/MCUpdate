Competition time! J!NX are looking for t-shirt illustrations that celebrate the “Unsung Heroes of Minecraft.”
Forget about Creepers and Steve for this one: it’s about ocelots, iron golems, and sheep; the smaller guys that sometimes get forgotten.
Another thing: JiNX have boosted the prize pool since the competition was first announced.

Visit [J!NX](https://web.archive.org/web/20130603085905/http://www.jinx.com/design_contest_info.aspx?theme=7)
for the details. You have until June 3rd to submit your entries.<br>
Good luck!

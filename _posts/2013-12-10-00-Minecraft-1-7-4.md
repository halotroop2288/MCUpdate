Itâ€™s time for an update again!

+ Added Twitch.tv broadcasting integration (see below)
* Improved Realms menus
* Fixed render distance above 8
* Various bugs have been taken care of

~~To use the Twitch broadcasting you need to link your Mojang account with your Twitch account.~~
~~This only works with migrated accounts (in other words, if you login using your email address instead of your username, you can use the Twitch integration).~~
~~The linking is done via the account settings, which can be found here:~~

~~[https://account.mojang.com/me/settings](https://web.archive.org/web/20131210083121/https://account.mojang.com/login)~~

To start broadcasting, simply press F6 while playing. You find more options in the menus.

The integration currently only works on Windows Vista or later, and on Mac OS X Lion (10.7) or later.

You can always get more in-depth development updates on the official [Mojang blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20131212071443/https://mojang.com/)!

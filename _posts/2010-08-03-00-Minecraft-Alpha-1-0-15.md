* Lava now sets stuff on fire
* Tried to make fire act better (need feedback)
* Extremely silly third person swinging animation
* You can enter the IP to a server now. The first, buggy server will be released tomorrow.
* Fixed the M.

Thank you everyone who emailed me about the stuttering,
I will work on fixing that tomorrow as well while people are testing SMP. =)

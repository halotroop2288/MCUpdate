* Red torch not gates now only signal into blocks above them, or to stuff right next to them.
This makes them still useful for underground wiring, yet makes them much more predictable than before.
* The red dust stuff won’t connect through solid blocks diagonally down any more
* Some minor art tweaks to the dust.

On a related note, this “not giving stuff official names any more” plan has a flaw..
It makes it really hard to talk about stuff on the blog. :-D

Unless the dust has HUGE flaws now, I will leave it as it is.
I’ll add more triggers and so, though, and possibly more sensors (sunlight?)

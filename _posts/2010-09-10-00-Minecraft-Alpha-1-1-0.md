**Seecret Friday 9**

The Seecret Friday part ended up being extremely tiny this time around, but that’s because I made sure to add this:

+ Added server-side inventory
+ Made the server save player locations when they leave the server
+ Made chests work in SMP
+ Made signs work in SMP
+ Made furnaces work in SMP
+ Added monsters=false to server.properties.You can turn it on for experimental monsters, but you can’t hurt them directly yet. (Fire works, though!)

But this is NOT SECURE YET! I decided to just focus on making it functional first so I actually got it out.

I’ll work on inventory security and server-side health management next week.
Server-side health means you’ll be able to fight monsters and perhaps even other players. :D

[edit:]

Oh. My. Dog. I need to invest in a better server solution RIGHT AWAY, like next week!
Please be patient while the server tries to keep up with sending out all the updated clients!

Usually finding out something you love is now full of bees is bad news (your cat, parents, self, etc).
We hope you find the abundance of bees now buzzing merrily in Minecraft: Java Edition a delightful exception!
Along with the Buzzy Bees, you'll also find honeycomb, honeycomb blocks, honey blocks, the honey bottle,
bee nests and beehives and absolutely no cats full of bees.
Actually, I'm just gonna quickly double-check that last one...

Enjoy!

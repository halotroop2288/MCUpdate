The server update isn’t mandatory, but it’s HIGHLY recommended

* Rewrote Leaf Decay for the seventeenth time, and as a result..
* .. fixed HUGE fps drops in single player
* .. fixed players getting spammed with data and getting disconnected in SMP
* .. felt like a sexy programming god
* Fixed the item dupe bug in SMP
* Fixed “fancy” characters not working in the game by detaching font resources from the code.

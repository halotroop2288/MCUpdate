Client version 1.2.5<br>
Server version 0.2.7 (not mandatory, but you might want to update anyway)

* Fixed a rather bad memory leak bug in the server (entity position updates accumulated in orphaned player objects)
* Riding carts and boats now works properly when you travel long distances.
* Harvesting crops no longer yields fake seeds
* Removed `/home` (sorry!)
* Snowballs again!

I will start looking at server-side inventory soon in an attempt to reach beta soon.<br>
I’ll also fix mob jump animations in SMP, the ugly black lights, and make leaves decay again.
Once that’s in place, BETA! :-D

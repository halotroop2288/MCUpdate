I had some spare time over, so:

Client:

* You can now press enter from the “join server” screen instead of clicking the button
* Fixed a bug with potentially invisible players

Server:

* New command: “`tp `”, moves player1 to player2’s location.
* New command: “`save-all`” forces a full save to disc
* New command: “`save-off`” disables all saving (except save-all)
* New command: “`save-on`” re-enables saving

If you’re writing a backup script, please consider making it call “save-off” before doing the backup,
and “save-on” when it’s done. If you don’t do this, you can get corrupted zones in your backup.

[edit:]
Ok, I’ve ACTUALLY added the save-on command now. Sorry about that. ;)<br>
(You need to re-download the server)

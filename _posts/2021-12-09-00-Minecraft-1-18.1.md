We’re now releasing Minecraft: Java Edition 1.18.1. This release fixes a critical security issue for multiplayer servers, changes how the world fog works to make more of the world visible, and fixes a couple of other bugs.

If you are running a multiplayer server, we highly encourage you to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.

Enjoy!

## 1.18.1 Changelog

### Technical Changes

- Fixed an issue that would cause players on low-bandwidth connections to get timeout errors when connecting to a server

- Instead of applying fog as a spherical volume it is now applied as a cylindrical volume
